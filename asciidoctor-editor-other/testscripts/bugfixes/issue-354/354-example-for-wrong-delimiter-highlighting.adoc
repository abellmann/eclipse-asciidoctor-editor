== Example

== At the beginning
* list 1a
* list 2a
- other

  This is a literal paragraph!

.Title

== With space before
 * list 1b - NOT a literal paragraph
 * list 2b  - NOT a literal paragraph
  - other  - NOT a literal paragraph
  .Title  - NOT a literal paragraph
  
  This is a literal paragraph!
  
normal text, so
  this is also NOT a literal paragraph
  
 . list 2a
 . list 2b
 . list 3c  
 
normal text
  
=== Space length different
*What about different space-length?*

text

 1 space - I am a literal paragraph
  2 spaces - I am a literal paragraph
   3 spaces - I am a literal paragraph
    4 spaces - I am a literal paragraph
    
== literal paragraph with list entries
  I am a literal paragraph
  * one - not a list entry
  * two
    - sub
  
  
== Other headline
  this is a literal paragraph here because headline before
  
.Title2
   this is a literal paragraph here because title before
 
****
